Hi! ðŸ‘‹ &nbsp; This is the home of NLP-with-friends, 
an **online seminar series** made by students, for students, where everyone is invited!

We meet **Wednesdays** on a weekly or bi-weekly basis to talk about interesting works in NLP (both ongoing and already published). The presenters are **students** in the field of NLP and related areas, who will talk about their own work.

The idea for this setting is to be a supportive and engaging environment for students to present their work and discuss work with other students and researchers around the world.
Following each talk (or during, if the presenter allows) there will be time to ask questions, discuss relevant topics, and wonder about what's next.
We hope this format will foster greater kinship between students around the globe, provide students more experience with presenting, create a judgement-free forum for asking questions, and give us all a chance to learn from each other -- both failures and successes!

We are committed to diversity of topics and presenters; we hope to connect students all over the world, and give the stage to a range of topics and speakers.
